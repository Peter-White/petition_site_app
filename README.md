# petition_site_app
With my website, a user will be able to input their first name, last name, age, home adress, email and an optional
statement into six diffrent input boxes. If the user enters an interger within the age input box greater than or equal to 18 and a unique email address the app accepts the user input, otherwise they are denied. Upon pressing the submit button below, the information provided by the user
will be appended to the database table "signers" as a new row. The user's first name and last name will then be 
displayed in a div element as an li element. This li element will be clickable and when clicked will display the 
user's optional quote in a div element. Finally, a counter will return the number of rows in the "signer" table as a 
numerical value.
